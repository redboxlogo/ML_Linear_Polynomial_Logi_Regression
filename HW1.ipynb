    "In this assignment, we will be exploring the car dataset and analyzing their fuel efficiency. <br >\n",
    "Specifically, we will do some exploratory analysis with visualizations, then we will build a model for Simple Linear Regression, a model for Polynomial Regression, and one model for Logistic Regression. <br >\n",
    "**The given dataset is already modified and cleaned**, but you can find [the original information here.](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/auto+mpg).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset Attribute Information\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **mpg**: Miles per gallon. This is one primary measurement for car fuel efficiency.\n",
    "2. **displacement** : The cylinder volumes in cubic inches.\n",
    "3. **horsepower** : Engine power.\n",
    "4. **weight** : In pounds.\n",
    "5. **acceleration** : The elapsed time in seconds to go from 0 to 60mph.\n",
    "6. **origin** : Region of origin.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Libraries that can be used: numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, seaborn, plotly, matplotlib\n",
    "Any libraries used in the discussion materials are also allowed.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Other Notes\n",
    " - Don't worry about not being able to achieve high accuracy, it is neither the goal nor the grading standard of **this** assignment. <br >\n",
    " - If not specified, you are not required to do hyperparameter tuning, but feel free to do so if you'd like.\n",
    " - Discussion materials should be helpful for doing the assignments."

    "Requirements & notes\n",
    " - When computing correlation, make sure to drop the column ``origin`` to avoid errors.\n",
    " - The computed correlation values should be shown on the plot.\n",
    " - Use a diverging color scale with the color range being \\[-1, 1\\] and center being 0 (if applicable)."
